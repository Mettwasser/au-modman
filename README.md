# A simplistic Among Us Mod Manager/Launcher
This App allows you to manage Among Us Mods with ease!

This App is for Windows only, Linux Support might come in the near future - if requested.

## How to use
You need the URL to the Zip file of the Mod you want to Download.

After that, head over to the `Mods` Tab, click "Add Mod", give it a Name, paste the Link, and enter a Version. Then click "Create".

Once it has finished loading, head to the `Profiles` Tab, click "Create Profile", give it a Name and select the Mods you want to use.

You can now Launch this Profile (which is related to the modded version of Among Us) by pressing on the green Button with the play icon.
